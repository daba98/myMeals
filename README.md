An Android app for managing, storing, and sharing recipes. In this app you can collect your recipes in nice and clear manner.
Organize your recipes in either one of the standard categories
- main meal
- soup
- salad
- cake
- dessert

or add your own custom category.
All recipes are stored on your phone such that you do not need an internet connection to access them. You can edit or delete the recipes at all time. Furthermore, you can share your recipes with your friends by uploading them to an online database. That way the recipe gets publicly available and everyone can download it to their local cookbook.
